It is the first of December, and that means the start of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023).
I am going to make an attempt at this every day, posting my coding solutions (as much as possible in F#). I will not be posting the questions, as they can be found online, and I will not be posting my final answer.

[The first question is called Trebuchet](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1).

I will first need a function that will be able to grab the first and last digits from a single row string.

{{< highlight fsharp >}}
let firstAndLastDigit (codedCalibration: string) =
    let digits =
        codedCalibration
        |> Seq.map id
        |> Seq.where (System.Char.IsDigit)
        |> Seq.toArray
    [| digits[0]; Seq.last digits |]
    |> System.String
    |> int

firstAndLastDigit "1abc2"
{{< /highlight >}}

```text
12
```

This might be enough to put it all together.

{{< highlight fsharp >}}
let exampleInput =
    "1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet"

exampleInput.Split '\n'
|> Seq.map firstAndLastDigit
|> Seq.sum
{{< /highlight >}}

This will have a final result of \`142\`.
