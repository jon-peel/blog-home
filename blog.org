I am starting a new blog.

The reason is that I have been enjoying React a lot, and Gatsby seems to be pretty cool at the moment.

I am not that great at design, but I can make small improvements over time, I am happy with what I have for now.

It is on [[https://github.com/Thorocaine/blog-home][github]] if you really do want to see the source, but it is pretty simple.

*** Update

This post has been migrated, it is now running on Hugo.
