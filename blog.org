** FSharp Blog :F#:dotnet:blog:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: fsharp-blog
:EXPORT_DATE: <2023-11-24 Fri 06:54>
:END:

I want to blog about F#, and .Net (or is it dotnet?)

#+begin_src fsharp :exports both
let greet () = "Hello, World!"

greet ()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hello, World!


** Second Post :blog:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: second-post
:EXPORT_DATE: <2023-11-24 Fri 07:24>
:END:

This is the second post.
I want to try output instead f results.

#+begin_src fsharp :exports output
printfn "Hello, World!"
#+end_src

doesn't print output, but it does print results.


#+begin_src fsharp :session sp :exports code
let greet name = $"Hello, {name}!"
#+end_src

Which is called with

#+NAME: sp-call-greet
#+begin_src fsharp :session sp :exports both
greet "Jonathan P"
#+end_src

Which will then return:
#+RESULTS: sp-call-greet
: Hello, Jonathan!

[[https://adventofcode.com/][Advent of Code]] will be starting soon, and I want to see if can manage any of the challenges using F#.
